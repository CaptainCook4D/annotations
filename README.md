# Recipe Annotation

This figure illustrates, with an example, the three steps followed in the creation of an action-centric graph for a recipe. Given the recipe text as shown in recipe selection, we identify and mark all the actions necessary for the execution of the recipe as shown in identify actions. Once these actions are identified, we develop them into steps (as shown in develop steps) where each step contains only one of the actions identified before. These steps are used to construct an action-centric graph for the recipe resulting in a structure

# Data Annotation

We provide step annotations for all the videos. Following video describes the process we used to annotate the data.
